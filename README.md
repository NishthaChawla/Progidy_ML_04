# Task-4 for my Prodigy InfoTech internship! 

## Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning
I recently worked on a project to build a hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I trained a model to classify different hand gestures from image data. The model analyzes key features such as hand shape, position, and motion to predict gestures accurately, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Key Insights:

- Model Accuracy: Achieved a classification accuracy of 99.98%, reflecting how well the model recognized and classified different hand gestures across the test dataset.
- Feature Importance: Key features like hand shape, size, and motion patterns contributed significantly to the modelâ€™s ability to classify gestures correctly.
- Prediction Example: For a test image of a raised fist gesture, the model predicted the gesture as "fist," closely aligning with expectations based on the dataset.
This project highlights the potential of using machine learning, specifically computer vision techniques, to create gesture recognition systems that can enable intuitive human-computer interactions and control systems.
